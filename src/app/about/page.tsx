          Welcome to <span className="font-semibold">CleanModo</span>! We believe that a clean and organized home is the foundation for a peaceful and productive life. But we also know that keeping up with this order can be an overwhelming and stressful task amidst the hustle and bustle of daily life.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          That’s why we created CleanModo. This project started as a simple idea: What if we could use technology to ease the burden of household chores? What if there was a smart assistant that plans and organizes your cleaning tasks based on your specific needs, whether you live in a small apartment or a large house, with or without pets?
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          Our mission is to give you the tool that puts you back in control of your time, reduces your feeling of being overwhelmed, and frees your mind to focus on the things that matter most in your life. We don’t just offer a to-do list; we offer a smart plan that adapts to you, helps you build sustainable cleaning habits, and brings clarity to your routine.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4 text-lg">
          We are a small team passionate about technology and organization, striving to make CleanModo the perfect companion for anyone seeking a clearer, more organized life.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg">
          <span className="font-semibold">Thank you for joining us</span> on this journey to a cleaner, happier home.
